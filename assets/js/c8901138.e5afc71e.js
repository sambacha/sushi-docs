Most users have experience placing limit orders on centralized exchanges such as Binance and Kraken, or on traditional finance exchanges like Forex and Robinhood. When a limit order is placed on a centralized platform, such agencies determine how they would like to fill the limit orders by themselves, and to a degree, users have to trust them to do it in good faith.

Limit orders are used to anticipate future price action, so they usually have an expiration that can be adjusted by the user.

The providers for decentralized limit orders like Sushi\u2019s don\u2019t have to take any risk, because every order that fills generates profit for the filler bots.

The smart contract will then fill the order by sending funds to the user's wallet, and in the process it sends the limit order fee to the filler bot as profit. This exchange of funds is essentially an exchange of balances that is communicated via an encryption. The magic of public key cryptography allows for these messages between the users\u2019 wallets, the filler bot's wallet, and SushiSwap's smart contracts to pass securely, as the private keys of these entities are obscured by cryptographic algorithms that can only be solved in one direction.
