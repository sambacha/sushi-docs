The benefit to being on the Onsen menu is that the projects themselves aren\u2019t forced to incentivize their communities to provide liquidity for their tokens, because Sushi does it for them. This eases the burden of impermanent loss, and decreases the price impact/slippage of individual purchases, making purchasing more cost efficient.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"Tutorials/How to create a Miso auction":{"id":"Tutorials/How to create a Miso auction","title":"How to Create a MISO Auction","description":"Please note that while the final form of the UI will continue to change, the primary functions, inputs and information can be expected to stay relatively similar.

In return, SushiSwap rewards those who provide temporary access to their tokens with a share of the 0.25% fee charged to traders of the respective token pair, proportional to the amount of liquidity they added to the pool.
