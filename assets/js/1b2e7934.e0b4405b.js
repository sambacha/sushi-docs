For example, if you want to buy $SUSHI tokens with $USDC, you will need to approve Sushi's access to the USDC token by paying a small connection fee.

So, in order to access the SushiSwap platform (or MISO, Kashi, etc.), you will need ETH in your wallet to pay the fees. If you do not have any Ether, you will need to purchase some from a centralized exchange that services your region.
