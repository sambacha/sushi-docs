It enables users to record an artificial balance for their tokens while they're in reserve, so they can be actionable in more than one way at the same time.

If an institution is granted the permission, it can lend and borrow more than they have, and earn yield by taking calculated risks with their borrowed capital."),(0,r.kt)("p",null,"Like the fractional reserve system, the BentoBox retains a reserve of capital that can be used for different purposes simultaneously, without incurring losses to the principle. Both the BentoBox and fractional reserve banking operate on the assumption that individual positions can mutually benefit from shared liquidity, because a bank run is unlikely on a large scale. This leads to higher overall capital efficiency, which is generally the goal of financial instruments.

We are often reminded that central banks are allowed to lend their cash on hand as many times over. In the US, depending on an institution\u2019s holdings, the amount they can leverage is higher or lower. So, if an institution has very large holdings, they can leverage more proportionally to the amount than what they have in reserve. This means that for institutions with greater reserves, essentially the value of a single dollar is greater than for institutions with less in reserve. Similarly for our users, after the completion of Trident, the value of a single dollar is greater in the BentoBox than in any other Automated Market Maker (or AMM, for short). Unlike in the traditional banking system, however, the benefit of this capital efficiency is distributed to the users, i.e. the depositors, and not the banks themselves. This is what people are referring to when they say DeFi "disintermediates" traditional finance.'))}f.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
